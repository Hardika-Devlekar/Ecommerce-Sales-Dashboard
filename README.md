# Ecommerce-Sales-Dashboard

In this project, I used Power BI to create an insightful and interactive eCommerce Sales Dashboard, leveraging an Excel CSV dataset to analyze key sales metrics. The dashboard enables businesses to track sales performance, identify trends, and make data-driven decisions to drive growth.

Key Features:
- Sales performance by product, region, and time 📈
- Profit margins and revenue analysis 💰
- Customer insights and purchase behavior 🛒
- Dynamic filtering and drill-down capabilities 🔍

By integrating Power BI’s robust features with data from Excel, this dashboard provides real-time, actionable insights to help eCommerce businesses optimize their strategy and improve overall performance.
